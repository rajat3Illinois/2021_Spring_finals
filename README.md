Soccer World Cup 2022 (Type 3 Analysis)

Rajat Kumar (rajat3illinois)

Introduction: - 

Being an soccer player, and an ardent fan of soccer, I am performing the data analysis on the world most followed tournament that is the World Cup. 2022 is still a bit far from now, but the qualifications for the soccer world cup is still around the corner. Qatar the host nation is automatically qualified. The remaining spots are yet to be filled. 


Hypothesis: - 

1) There is a moderate chance that the curse of defending champions bowing out from the group stage of the world cup.

2) It is highly leikely that the host nation would atleast reach the knockout stage.

3) There is no guarantee that the winner of the world cup would be a top 10 team

This is just a thought process of this simulation and can change with the development process. I am thinking of implementing a prediction scenario for the next season as well, if there is time for further extrapolation.
