Soccer World Cup 2022 (Type 3 Analysis)

Rajat Kumar (rajat3illinois)

Introduction: - 

Being an soccer player, and an ardent fan of soccer, I am performing the data analysis on the world most followed tournament that is the World Cup. 2022 is still a bit far from now, but the qualifications for the soccer world cup is still around the corner. Qatar the host nation is automatically qualified. The remaining spots are yet to be filled. 

There was the 2018 world cup analysis in the previous Programming Analytics batches which seems to flawed in terms of its hypothesis. 
Furthermore, it looks like they have overemphasised on the Fifa Ranking to determine the attacking and the defending attributes of a World Cup Team

Taking the help from this githib code and bringing into account knowldege and facts, I would be enhancing the techniques for the FIFA World Cup 2022.

Hypothesis: - 

1) There is a less chance that the curse of defending champions bowing out from the group stage of the world cup.

2) It is highly likely that the host nation would atleast reach the knockout stage.

Data: -
