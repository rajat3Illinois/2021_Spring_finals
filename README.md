Soccer World Cup 2022 (Type 3 Analysis)

Rajat Kumar (rajat3illinois)

Introduction: - 

Being an soccer player, and an ardent fan of soccer, I am performing the data analysis on the world most followed tournament that is the World Cup. 2022 is still a bit far from now, but the qualifications for the soccer world cup is still around the corner. Qatar the host nation is automatically qualified. The remaining spots are yet to be filled. 

There was the 2018 world cup analysis in the previous Programming Analytics batches which seems to flawed in terms of its hypothesis. 
Furthermore, it looks like they have overemphasised on the Fifa Ranking to determine the attacking and the defending attributes of a World Cup Team

Taking the help from this githib code and bringing into account knowldege and facts, I would be enhancing the techniques for the FIFA World Cup 2022.

The FIFA World Cup is the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world.

32 teams qualify for the tournament with the host nation given an automatic qualification.

The qualified team comes from six confederations (continents): 
CAF (Africa)
AFC (Asia)
CONENBOL (South America)
CONCACAF (North America)
Oceania
UEFA (Europe)

Tournament Format is as follow :- 
Group Stages (32 teams split into 8 groups)
Last -16 Stage (Top 2 teams from each group qualify)
Quarter-Final
Semi-Final
Final

Purpose:- 

With this Project, I aim to enhance the previous developed World Cup 2018 simulation from the Programming Analytics Spring 2018 students and making an enhanced simulation for the World Cup 2022. (Type III analysis)

Previous Project Link: - https://github.com/hiralrayani/World-Cup-Simulator.git

Loopholes in Previous Project:- 

1) The previous simulation, assumed that toss would play a key role in deciding the match result.
2) It didnâ€™t consider the pot seedings based on ranking in assigning the teams into various groups.
3) Randomly assigning the team the attacking prowess and defensive prowess based on their current rankings.
4) There were no consideration for the players data belonging to each team to compute the teams attacking, defensive and goalkeeper strength.

Hypothesis: - 

1) The curse of defending champion (France) bowing out from the Group Stage and / or not even making the world cup is very unlikely.

2) It is highly likely that the host nation would qualify for the knockout stages.

Execution:- 

Execute the WorlCupQualification.py file. Make sure all the data files are in the same directory as the python file.
